# Data Visualizations on climate change caused by Humans

## Introduction

Earth has surpassed 4.5 billion years of life span with human interventions possibly starting back since the last 200,000 years. We are currently facing extreme weather events which has raised so many questions on human activities. Indeed it is true that humans have increased the hydro carbon energy consumption multifold in the last 5 decades. Today's extreme weather conditions such as forest fires, shrinkage in ice mass, rise in sea level, severe flooding due to extreme rain or snow or cyclonic depressions, severe drought for extended period of time etc. Often we here global warming is the cause. Here we will analyze, evaluate 5 visuals, infer and summarize at the end.We will evaluate the 5 visuals on the following principles.

   * Evidence
   * Intuitiveness
   * Perspective
   * Persuade
   * Completeness 
   * Inspire action

 "Climate Change" and "Global Warming" are almost used synonymously everywhere. Global warming refers to global temperature changes due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in atmosphere. Climate change refers to changes in measures of climate over a period of time such as rainfall, snow, temperature, wind patterns, intensity of extreme weather events (such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions etc).
NASA cites global warming as a significant contributor to modern climate changes [https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence]. Humans have significant foot print in global warming changes and hence the climate change. Scientists from both the isles differ on agreeing that human carbon dioxide emissions emissions from human activities are the root cause of this alarming change.

First the evidence, Scientists have studied the evidence from tree rings, air trapped in ice glaciers, ocean sediments, coral reefs and also some sedimentary rocks to collect the history of earth warming trends. Scientists could trace the history and recreate the global warming trend since the last 800,000 years. Using this evidence, they have recreated a record of earth's past climates which is called "paleoclimates". The above figure shows rate of temperature change over time using Paleoclimate model. It is very intuitive that the current trend of temperature increase over the last couple of decades is very high compared to the past.

Evidential Data from the history shows a 5 degree Celsius change took about 5000 to 7000 years. From the above graph, you see that in the last century alone the temperature increase is 0.7 degree celsius which is 10 times faster than the average. Models predict that the earth will be warmer by 2 to 6 degree Celsius in the next 100 years which is 20 times faster than the average. This rate is very alarming as it will get out of control pretty quickly.

This graph gives a great perspective that indeed global warming is happening now and what we are witnessing now is the effect of warming trend. This graph is sufficient and complete to prove sufficiently the correlation between the warming trend and extreme. This projection of alarming trend 20 times faster to reach 2 degree Celsius inspires action to engage and explore further.

The data sourced the activities as follows.
Human activities include
	* Green house gas (GHG) emission 
	* Anthropogenic tropospheric aerosol
	* Land use
	* Ozone changes
Natural activities include
	* solar flares and solar storms
	* volcanic eruptions in earth and ocean
	* Orbital changes


The above graph intuitively shows humans are major contributors to this global warming trend. Data collected also showed the biggest contributor is GHG and it is significantly larger in the last 60 to 70 years. This also gives a perspective on human interference in global eco system change. This graphs persuades the reader to explore further on GHG and how to reduce the GHG emissions.

Well, hearing from the opposite isle that not all effect is by humans and GHG effect is very minimal to increase temperature by 0.7 degree Celsius. Global warming and cooling is a phenomenon that existed before and is repeating now. The graph argues that Ice mass shrink (which is reported by Global warming Scientists as an effect of global warming) started a century before humans started consuming hydro carbon energy at a mass scale as energy source. Even though humans have achieved great technological milestones in every field there are few developing countries which is not fully electrified. Other sources cite that every country in the past 50 decades is showing greater GDP growth, lower mortality rate, lower fatalities rates in warm climate epidemic diseases such as malaria, measles, chicken pox etc.
