# Data Visualizations on climate change caused by Humans

## Introduction

"Climate Change" and "Global Warming" are almost used synonymously everywhere.
Global warming refers to global temperature changes due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in atmosphere.
Climate change refers to changes in measures of climate over a period of time such as rainfall, snow, temperature, wind patterns, 
intensity of extreme weather events (such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes  etc).
NASA cites global warming as a significant contributor to modern climate changes [https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence]. Humans have significant foot print in global warming changes and hence the climate change. In this article, we are going to discuss climate change caused by humans. I put together a conceptual framework to evaluate, infer and summarize findings using five visuals.
The visuals will be evaluated based on the following principles.

   * Evidence
   * Intuitiveness
   * Perspective
   * Persuade
   * Completeness 
   * Inspire action

## Evaluation:

We present 5 visuals below and evaluate the visuals.
	* paleoclimate
        * HumanNature.png graph

### Evidence:
	Earth has surpassed 4.5 billion years of life span with human possible human interventions starting back since the last 200,000 years. Scientists have studied the evidence from tree rings, air trapped in ice glaciers, ocean sediments, coral reefs and also some sedimentary rocks to collect the history of earth warming trends. They could trace the history and recreate the global warming trend since the last 800,000 years.

Using this evidence, they have recreated a record of earth's past climates which is called "paleoclimates". Analyzing the Paleoclimate reveals evidence that the rate of climatic warming is alarmingly faster than ever before even though the current temperature has not surpassed previous peaks. Evidential Data from the history shows a 5 degree Celsius change took about 5000 years. From the above graph, you see that in the last century alone the temperature increase is 0.7 degree celsius which is 10 times faster than the average. Models predict that the earth will be warmer by 2 to 6 degree Celsius in the next 100 years which is 20 times faster than the average. This rate is very alarming as it will get out of control pretty quickly.

###Intuitive:
	It is almost unequivocally undeniable that humans are significant contributors to global warming. The graph below shows average global temperature changes caused by human activities and natural activities. 
	Human activities included 
		* Green house gas emission
		* Anthropogenic tropospheric aerosol
		* Land use
		* Ozone changes
        Natural activities included 
		* solar flares and solar storms
		* volcanic eruptions in earth and ocean
		* Orbital changes
      	Data collected shows the biggest contributor is GHG (green house gas emissions) and it is significantly larger in the last 60 to 70 years.
